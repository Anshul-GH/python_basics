Hello and welcome to this video series. 
In this series, i will be covering the core concepts of OOPs and understanding their implementation via Python.

In this first video we will cover - classes and objects.

Now before we get started with learning what are classes and objects, let's first understand the need to go for classes and objects.

Let's take an example. Say, we have a function called calculateSalary() which can be called on an Employee
to calculate the salary of that employee. Now in a normal program this function can be called on a Student as well but that doesn't make much of a sense. And we want to restrict the access to this function only to an employee and not to a student.

So classes and objects help us do that by placing this function called calculateSalary() within a box and we seal that box and make it available only to an employee and not to a student.

Now let's understand what are classes and objects.
So by the definition, classes are a logical collection of attributes and methods and objects are instances of class.

Class can be considered as a template and object is the implementation of the template. So at the time of creating an object you're giving life to a class which is also called as an object instantiation.

A class consists of attributes and methods.
Lets see how to identify them.

Now when you are just getting started with an object oriented programming concept it is pretty simple
to understand this concept and divide your program in this way.

There are three things you need to identify from what you're trying to implement.
The first thing is the noun which is name a place or an animal or a thing, which will be the name of your class.
The second thing that you need to look for is an adjective which are properties that further define your noun, which will be the attributes of your class.
And the third thing that you need to look for is verbs which are the actions that are performed by your noun, which will be the methods of your class.

So now that you have understood what are classes and objects, let's move on to 

So now that you have understood what are classes and objects, let's move on to implementing a class Employee and instantiate it to create employees and check if they have met their weekly sales targets.
